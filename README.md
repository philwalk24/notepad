## Description

This project is supposed to allow a user to generate helpful notes so they can remember to complete tasks. It uses express.js to use GET and POST requests in order to update the page with their notes. Unfourtunatley I was unable to complete this project, but I got VERY close. When I get my feedback I am confident I will definitley have it 100% completed this week. I also still need to deploy it with Heroku.

## Installation

First, you need to clone the github repo. Then, in the same folder as "server.js", you need to run two commands: "npm i install" and "npm install uniqid". 

## Usage
When the program actually works (soon!), you can run "node server.js". you click get started and then you can write a note, and then submit it when you are done. You can view your notes in the /notes tab on the URL. Right now you cant submit the notes you write, but thats coming very soon. I know what to do I'm just out of time because I've been battling a migrane the past 2 days.

## Testing

I didnt write any tests for this program and they will be added within the next day or two.

## Contributing

I am the only one contributing to this project; no one else can. It also can only be cloned, it wont be deployed.

## Credits

For this project, I used a lot of the Activity 28 from module 11, which I will continue to use until I have it done.
